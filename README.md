## Disclaimer

- If you get banned by Blizzard, it's not my responsibility.
- Don't abuse the bot or you might face consequences.
- Avoid converting it into an executable as it becomes easier to detect. Instead, compile it in VS Code or any similar editor.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Python
1. Download Python 3.12 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. During installation, make sure to select "Add Python to PATH".

### Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code
1. Download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Step 3: Install Code Runner Extension in VS Code
1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for "Code Runner" and install it.
4. This extension will add a "Run" button at the top right corner for easy code execution.

### Step 4: Install Required Python Packages
1. Open a terminal in VS Code by clicking on `Terminal` in the top menu and selecting `New Terminal`.
2. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python numpy pyautogui pygetwindow Pillow
   
### Step 5: Restart Your Computer
It's a good idea to restart your computer to ensure all installations are properly set up.

### Step 6: Running the Bot
Open the bot script in VS Code.
Click the "Run" button at the top right corner to compile and run the code.

## How to Use
1. Position your in-game camera so the bobber is inside the window and can be tracked.
2. Sometimes the red values aren't correct. Adjust with the trackbar until only the feather is marked green.

## Additional Tips
- You might have to run VS Code as admin for it to work properly.
- Avoid running the bot for long periods of time.
- You can change key bindings at the top of the code. If you need help with the correct string for a key binding, feel free to ask ChatGPT.
- IF YOU GET BANNED IT IS NOT ON ME, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!
